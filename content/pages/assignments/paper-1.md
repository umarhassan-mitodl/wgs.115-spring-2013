In a short essay of approximately 2–4 pages, consider a specific technology and how it is gendered, making reference to at least one of our course readings as you do so. You may wish to incorporate a close description of the technology, or provide an analysis of the way(s) in which it is marketed (in which case please provide a link or copy of the advertisement or marketing text you are analyzing). What are the implications of the gendered use of this technology in terms of work, social roles, and/or the categories of masculinity and femininity? In what ways is your reading of this technology historically, culturally, or socially contingent? How does it relate to any of the dichotomies about technology discussed in our readings so far—would you say they are reinforced or blurred by this example?
